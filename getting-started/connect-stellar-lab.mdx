# Connect Stellar Lab

One way to confirm that Quickstart was successfully started and is available is to connect to Quickstart from [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org).

Navigate to [Stellar Lab](https://lab.stellar.org) and in the top right corner, use the dropdown to select the Custom network. This will allow you to provide connection details - use these testnet details:

RPC URL: http://localhost:8000/rpc 
Horizon URL: http://localhost:8000 
Netw. passphrase: “Standalone Network ; February 2017”


 
Switch to the Custom network and you can start to interact with Quickstart. A good first task could be to navigate to the Account tab, create an account, and fund it with Friendbot (faucet).
