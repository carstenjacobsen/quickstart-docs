# Deploy Smart Contract

Now you can deploy a smart contract on the Quickstart local network. If you already have a smart contract, you can deploy your existing smart contract, otherwise, you can follow this guide to create a smart contract and build it. 

## Create Identity
Before you can deploy and invoke a smart contract, you need to create an identity on the local network. The identity is a required parameter, referred to as `source-account` or `source`. This is how you can create an identity on the local network called `bob`:

```sh
stellar keys generate --global bob --network local --fund
```

The identity will have a private and a public key, and can be called by the name `bob` for convenience. 

## Deploy contract
Deploying a smart contract to Quickstart testnet is not very different from deploying a smart contract to the public testnet. Specify the RPC URL to be Quickstart’s and you can deploy it:

stellar contract deploy \ --network local \ --source-account bob \ --rpc-url http://localhost:8000/rpc \ --wasm target/wasm32-unknown- unknown/release/hello_world.wasm --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"

  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
  --alias hello_world
```

stellar contract deploy `
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_world.wasm `
  --source alice `
  --network testnet `
  --alias hello_world
```

</TabItem>

Invoke contract
Now you have deployed the smart contract to the Quickstart testnet, you can also invoke it:

stellar contract invoke \ --id CBIVWSMHU...62VB7S2OI73C \ --source bob \ --network testnet \ -- \ hello \ --to RPC


That’s it!

Now you can dive into some of the benefits of running your own local node with Quickstart. Some benefits are that it’s faster to invoke a contract, you get better debugging options, etc.
